When working with this repository, start by reviewing these key documentation files:

- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** – Begin here for problem-solving. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project structure, client-server architecture, core modules, data flow, and key systems. Use it to understand how different parts of the codebase interact.

- **[DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](../DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md)** – Reference this guide for day-to-day development work. It covers development workflow, common tasks (adding blocks, items, network messages, UI elements, mobs), testing and debugging, best practices, and troubleshooting.
